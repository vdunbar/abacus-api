## Accessing the Abacus API with R

Using Abacus, UBC's data repository, explore basic concepts of using R to search for and download data via an API. Using an API to access data provides a unique way to explore the repository and to script repetitive tasks. Topics covered will be applicable to other APIs. This workshop assumes some level of comfort with R for the purposes of data wrangling; code will be described in plain language to guide participants through the process, but this will not be a 'how to' wrangle data.
